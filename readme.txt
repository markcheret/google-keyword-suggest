== Description ==

WordPress is the most used content management system on the Internet. Millions of new contents get published every day.
Therefore the team of [SEOmotion](http://www.seomotion.org/en/) wanted to improve keyword and topic research for
WordPress users to do even better search engine optimization and write awesome pieces of content a lot faster.

Keyword research can take you a long time for most topics, but you can reduce the time spent on finding proper keywords
to match users interests and desires - and of course be found in search results - by using
[Google Keyword Suggest by SEOmotion](http://www.seomotion.org/en/wordpress-plugins/google-keyword-suggest/).

suggest data for your chosen language and country in real time. You can create your awesome pieces of content right
in your WordPress installation and start searching for suggested keywords to implement without switching to
any other external tool or service.
